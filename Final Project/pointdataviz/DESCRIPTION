Description: This package includes three basic functions, which allow for the visualization of point data from a CSV file (comma delimitted). The first displays all input points	over a basemap. The second groups the points into clusters, which, as one zooms in, are better visualized. The last creates a heatmap, to show the overall trend in the geographic coverage of those input points.
